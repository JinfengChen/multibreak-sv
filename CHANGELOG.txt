Change Log for multibreak-sv
Anna Ritz (anna.m.ritz@gmail.com)

======================================================================
2016 January 28 (dev branch)
- Added an HMMtoMBSV.py that runs only the HMM deletions.
- Added an argument called --outercoords that takes the outer coords if specified. New default behavior is to take the inner coords (the reported breakpoints of the SV).

=======================================================================
2015 December 2
- Made a change to account for outer coordinates in the M5toMBSV.py script
- Changed the default behavior to determine Lmin/Lmax for every ESP for GASV clustering; the "--binsize" is an optional parameter, and if it isn't specified then no binning is done.  This differs from the old behavior, which had a default size of 200.

=======================================================================
2015 September 3
- Added a script to quickly post-process MultiBreak-SV output by generating
two different scores for each cluster: an SVFrequency score and an
AverageProbability score.

=======================================================================
2015 June 22
- Added a script to generate indepedent subproblems from GASV cluster output
so MultiBreak-SV can be run in parallel (e.g., on a cluster).

=======================================================================
2014 December 30
- Added MultiBreak-SV pre-processor code (M5toMBSV.py), which converts BLASR
.m5 output to MultiBreak-SV input.

=======================================================================
2014 October 15
- Intial commit of MultiBreak-SV code (Java program)
